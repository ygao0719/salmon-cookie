      Style up the public facing page (index.html) to make it appealing to customers. NOTE: You must use all of the images in the adjacent asset directory. Your client insists that you use Every. Single. One.

      Your public-facing index.html page should have all of the things you'd expect such a page to have for such a business: locations with addresses, hours open, contact information, and so us. Just do mockups of these things since this is not a real business, of course.

      You can also mock up references (either links or little sections on the index.html page) for things like About Us (company history and mission), Merchandise (sales of t-shirts, mugs, stickers, etc.), links to salmon events like the Salmon Days in Issaquah, etc.

      Apply a similar style to the sales.html page.
